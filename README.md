# Influx-Assignment

Influx - Node.js assignment
Short summary of what you need to do
Create a module that will help a group of people to split shared expenses during a trip or
vacation.
Deep Dive
1. Create a function to create a Trip Group ( Only one Trip group will be created for the
purpose of this exercise. So this function will only be called once). Use console.log() to
show the json structure of the created group. The trip group name should be your
name.
2. Create a function to Add a Member to the Trip group.
a. This function can be called multiple times.
b. Required validations may need to be done
c. Use console.log to show the resultant Trip group which should include the
newly added member.
3. Create a function to add expenses
a. Expenses should always be added against a member
b. Can be called multiple times with different or same expense amounts and for
different or same members
4. Create a function to show the expenses split across the members

2. Use of data structures, classes
3. Judicious use of coding elements to ensure best performance
4. The functions should continue to work when called with different expense values
